## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Git
- An API key from an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI , Gemini).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Osikoya17/AgentFlow.git
    cd AgentFlow
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your API keys and other environment-specific variables.

    ```env
    # .env.local

    # Example for OpenAI
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

    # Add other variables as needed, e.g., database connection strings, NextAuth secrets
    # NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    # NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_very_secret_string_here
    # DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    ```

    **Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file or expose your secret keys publicly. Ensure it's listed in your `.gitignore` file.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
